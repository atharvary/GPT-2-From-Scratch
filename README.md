## 📝 Overview  
I built a **Large Language Model (LLM)** completely from scratch using **PyTorch**, following the GPT architecture.  
This project helped me move from seeing LLMs as a mysterious *black box* to understanding them as a *glass box* — clear, interpretable, and deeply fascinating.  

Along the way, I learned how each part fits together — from tokenization to self-attention — and how modern LLMs actually generate coherent text.

## 🚀 Features  
- Implemented the **Transformer architecture** from scratch  
- Built the **Multi-Head Self-Attention mechanism**  
- Created **Token Embeddings** and **Positional Embeddings**  
- Followed the **GPT architecture** closely  
- Trained on a real text dataset and later **imported GPT-2 weights** for performance boost

## 📂 Dataset  
- **The Verdict** by *Edith Wharton*  
- Used for training and experimentation

## 📄 Learning Notes  
The code file itself is filled with self-explanatory notes so that with each run of the code cell, we are clear about what's happening.
